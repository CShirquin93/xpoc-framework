### Setup

Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed on your system; the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version is recommended for both. 

Build the `npm` package:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Start the server:
```
`npm run start`
```

By default, the server listens on port 3000; edit [server.ts](../../src/server.ts) to modify this.

### Usage

This sample portal offers three pages: one to edit XPOC manifest, one to view them, and one to verify XPOC-protected content.
